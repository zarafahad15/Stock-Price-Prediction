# Stock-Price-Prediction
Project Overview

This project predicts future stock prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network.
It applies time-series forecasting on historical stock data fetched automatically from Yahoo Finance, giving investors and analysts a data-driven way to estimate stock trends.

Tech Stack
	•	Programming Language: Python
	•	Libraries: TensorFlow / Keras, scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, yfinance
	•	IDE / Tools: Jupyter Notebook, VS Code
	•	Deployment (optional): Streamlit / Flask

⸻

Dataset Information
	•	Source: Yahoo Finance
	•	Example Ticker: AAPL (Apple Inc.)
	•	Features Used: Date, Close Price
	•	Time Period: 2015 – 2025

Each record includes the daily closing price of a given stock symbol.

Project Workflow
	1.	Data Collection:
Fetch stock data using the yfinance API.
	2.	Data Preprocessing:
	•	Keep only closing prices
	•	Normalize data with MinMaxScaler
	•	Create sequences of 60-day windows for LSTM input
	3.	Model Building:
	•	Two-layer LSTM network with Dropout
	•	Optimizer: Adam
	•	Loss: Mean Squared Error
	4.	Model Training:
	•	Train on 80% of historical data
	•	Evaluate on the remaining 20%
	5.	Prediction & Visualization:
	•	Predict the next 200 days of prices
	•	Plot Actual vs Predicted curves

Future Improvements
	•	Integrate real-time stock updates using WebSockets or APIs
	•	Add more features (volume, open, close, sentiment analysis)
	•	Deploy full dashboard via Streamlit
	•	Implement Transformer-based Time-Series Models

Would you like me to make a Streamlit app README + app.py code next so you can run this project as a live web dashboard (input ticker → get prediction + chart)?
